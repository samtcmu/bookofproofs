        \begin{problem}
            Given a weighted directed graph, $G = (V, E)$ and $\omega:E \rightarrow \set{N}$,
            where $V$ is a set of nodes, $\subs{E}{V^2}$ find a subgraph $G' = (V', E')$, and
            $\omega$ is a function that give a non-negative integral weight to each edge such
            that the following hold:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item
                    $V' = V$.
                \item
                    For pair of nodes $(u, v)$ there is a sequences of edges in $E'$ that can
                    get you from $u$ to $v$.
                \item
                    The following sum is minimized:
                    \[
                        \sum_{e \in E'} \omega(e)
                    \]
            \end{itemize}
        \end{problem}
        \begin{note}
            This problem can be used to solve the facebull puzzle.
        \end{note}
        \begin{note}
            I might have a reduction from the Travelling Salesman Problem to the problem
            above; therefore, this problem is NP-Hard. We might want to looking for heuristic
            algorithms or approximation algorithms for this problem.
